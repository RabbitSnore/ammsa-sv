    ## 1                      The discussion about sexual harassment on the job has mainly resulted in many a harmless behavior being misinterpreted as harassment
    ## 2                                                A lot of women strongly complain about sexual infringements for no real reason, just to appear emancipated
    ## 3                                                     When a single woman invites a single man to her flat she signals that she is not averse to having sex
    ## 4                                           Once a man and a woman have started "making out", a woman's misgivings against sex will automatically disappear
    ## 5                                                             Women often accuse their husbands of marital rape just to retaliate for a failed relationship
    ## 6                                                                                                Many women tend to exaggerate the problem of male violence
    ## 7                                               A man's sexuality functions like a steam boiler - when the pressure gets to high, he has to "let off steam"
    ## 8                      Nowadays, the victims of sexual violence receive sufficient help in the form of women's shelters, therapy offers, and support groups
    ## 9                                                                                Many women tend to misinterpret a well-meant gesture as a "sexual assault"
    ## 10                                      To get custody for their children, women often falsely accuse their ex-husband of a tendency toward sexual violence
    ## 11                                                                                      When it comes to sexual contacts, women expect men to take the lead
    ## 12                                                                                                       After a rape, women nowadays receive ample support
    ## 13                                          When a woman starts a relationship with a man, she must be aware that the man will assert his right to have sex
    ## 14                                                                                     Women like to play coy. This does not mean that they do not want sex
    ## 15                                                                                                    Alcohol is often the culprit when a man rapes a woman
    ## 16                                         If a woman invites a man to her home for a cup of coffee after a night out this means that she wants to have sex
    ## 17                                                                                      Nowadays, men who really sexually assault women are punished justly
    ## 18                                            As long as they don't go too far, suggestive remarks and allusions simply tell a woman that she is attractive
    ## 19                                                     Interpreting harmless gestures as "sexual harassment" is a popular weapon in the battle of the sexes
    ## 20                                                                           Most women prefer to be praised for their looks rather than their intelligence
    ## 21     Instead of worrying about alleged victims of sexual violence society should rather attend to more urgent problems, such as environmental destruction
    ## 22 Nowadays, a large proportion of rapes is partly caused by the depiction of sexuality in the media as this raises the sex drive of potential perpetrators
    ## 23                                           Any woman who is careless enough to walk through "dark alleys" at night is partly to be blamed if she is raped
    ## 24          Because the fascination caused by sex is disproportionately large, our society's sensitivity to crimes in this area is disproportionate as well
    ## 25                                              In dating situations the general expectation is that the woman "hits the brakes" and the man "pushes ahead"
    ## 26                                                                        It is a biological necessity for men to release sexual pressure from time to time
    ## 27                                             When defining "marital rape", there is no clear-cut distinction between normal conjugal intercourse and rape
    ## 28                                                                              When a man urges his female partner to have sex, this cannot be called rape
    ## 29                       When politicians deal with the topic of rape, they do so mainly because this topic is likely to attract the attention of the media
    ## 30                     Although the victims of armed robbery have to fear for their lives, they receive far less psychological support than do rape victims
